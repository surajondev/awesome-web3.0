# Awesome Web 3.0

![Awesome Web3 Free Resources](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67496096/167166978-7e49d114-8d84-4f76-a1f4-0d3d304b9439.png)

The time has come to learn and excel in Web 3.0. The community is always growing. There are enough resources and help in the community to begin with.

For developers who are uncertain about web3's future, I strongly believe in web3 due to the following reasons:
- Recently, the community has been growing for learners and developers
- There are startup ideas revolving around web3
- This is the next big thing in web dev
- Companies are building tools that help the development process
- There are [grants](https://twitter.com/VittoStack/status/1491007572769488901) available for web3 projects
  
I do believe in Web3, so remove any doubts from your mind regarding web3 and let's get started.
